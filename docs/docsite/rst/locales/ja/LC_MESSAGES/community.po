It can become frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community members are expected to remain courteous and helpful to all users equally, regardless of skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing responses that prioritize snideness and snark over useful information. At the same time, everyone is expected to read the provided documentation thoroughly.

msgid "Pre-releases exist to draw testers. They give people who don't feel comfortable running from source control a means to get an early version of the code to test and give us feedback. To ensure we get good feedback about a release, we need to make sure all major changes in a release are put into a pre-release. Testers must be given time to test those changes before the final release. Ideally we want there to be sufficient time between pre-releases for people to install and test one version for a span of time. Then they can spend more time using the new code than installing the latest version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/community/release_managers.rst:29
msgid "The right length of time for a tester is probably around two weeks. However, for our three-to-four month development cycle to work, we compress this down to one week; any less runs the risk of people spending more time installing the code instead of running it. However, if there's a time crunch (with a release date that cannot slip), it is better to release with new changes than to hold back those changes to give people time to test between. People cannot test what is not released, so we have to get those tarballs out there even if people feel they have to install more frequently."
