Once installed, Ansible does not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running.  You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.  When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there's no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version."
